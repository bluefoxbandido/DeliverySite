Tom works for a company that is having a baby shower for an employee. The company is not a very 
large companyand is looking for a Pizza delivery company to cater or deliver to them. They are 
searching for something local. They googled a local company and came across our company. They 
were able to easily access our website by clicking the link in the search engine they were using.
As they entered the website they could see a few options. The options were to sign in as a guest or 
browse the options that the company provided. As the user signed in they were greeted with a page
that displayed several pizza product photos in the background and several images on the page.The 
customer can then choose to view the cart or place an order for pizza. After placing the final
order the customer can then checkout and pay for the pizza with card info and have the pizza delivered
to a specific location.
